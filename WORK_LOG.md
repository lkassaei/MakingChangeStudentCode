| Jan 25 |  9-11:30am   | I wrote a bunch of test cases on paper at first but couldn't really find a pattern/inspirataion from that method. Then I started thinking about it as almost like a tree, where from each value you are currently at, you have X amount of choices based of off the coins array. Then I started creating a recursive function where the base case is if the current value equals target. If not, I would loop through coins and call a new recursive function that adds coins[i] to the current value. After running this, I realized that I was never stopping the recursion if the current value > target, so I added another basecase where I would just return if I exceed. Then I realized that I am counting duplicates and I have to solve that. |

After that, I changed my main function to create the dp array and have the rows be the coins and the cols be the target. After that, I added the recursive case of adding together the inclusive and exclusive case of the current coin. I ran into some errors because I was trying to slice the array in the recursive function and pass in the new one for coins, but realized I should just have an index coinIndex as a parameter representing which coin I am at. |

Then I just added the cell above, and the cell to left, current coin to the left. It was not working so I got out the debugger but still couldn't solve it. |

I was thinking that we had no coins, so that square should equal 0. Instead, the square should be 1 if target % the last coin == 0. After checking that, everything worked out. I am still confused on how to make it O(t) space complexity, so I will work on that next class. |
